- Measure induced voltage of submarine copper cable through Basan (Republic of Korea) to Hamada (Japan) every 5 minutes.
- Using linear relationship between water transport through the Korea Strait and measured volatage, volume transport through the Korea Strait can be calculated (Kim et al., 2004)

- If you wand to download and use these data, please let me know by email.
